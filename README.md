# 🚀 Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Approach for DDoS Detection


## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Semi-Supervised Machine Learning** approach to detect **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks** efficiently. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model improves its accuracy while reducing dependency on fully labeled datasets.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Semi-Supervised Learning** - Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for better detection accuracy.  
✅ **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies abnormal network traffic patterns.  
✅ **Real-time Analysis** - Processes incoming traffic in real-time.  
✅ **Scalable & Efficient** - Works with large-scale network datasets.  
✅ **Robust Against Evasion** - Adaptable to evolving attack patterns.  

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 📜 Programming Languages:
- Python (backend and frontend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend design)

### 🤖 Machine Learning Frameworks/Techniques:
- **Algorithms**: Co-clustering, Extra-Trees (ensemble classifiers), SVM (mentioned in the conclusion).
- **Feature Selection**: Chi-square test, N-gram sequence analysis.
- **NLP Methods**: Text semantics analysis of HTTP flows treated as documents.

### 📂 Datasets:
- NSL-KDD
- UNBISCXIDS2012
- UNSW-NB15

### ⚙️ Technologies/Tools:
- **Web Framework**: Django
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Visualization Tools**: Column graphs, bar graphs, spline charts (for graphical analysis).
- **System Architecture**: Integration of NLP and semi-supervised ML for DDoS detection.

### 🌟 Additional Notes:
- The implementation uses Django for web interface development and MySQL for data storage.
- The project emphasizes combining unsupervised (co-clustering, entropy estimation) and supervised (Extra-Trees) methods for semi-supervised learning.

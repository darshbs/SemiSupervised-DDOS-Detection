# 🚀 Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Approach for DDoS Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Semi-Supervised Machine Learning** approach to detect **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks** efficiently. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model improves its accuracy while reducing dependency on fully labeled datasets.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Semi-Supervised Learning** - Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for better detection accuracy.  
✅ **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies abnormal network traffic patterns.  
✅ **Real-time Analysis** - Processes incoming traffic in real-time.  
✅ **Scalable & Efficient** - Works with large-scale network datasets.  
✅ **Robust Against Evasion** - Adaptable to evolving attack patterns.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Network Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset**: CIC-DDoS, KDDCup99, or similar network datasets  

## 📦 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SemiSupervised-DDOS-Detection.git
   cd SemiSupervised-DDOS-Detection
   ```
